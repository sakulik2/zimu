00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,016
<i>Hello and welcome back
to episode three</i>

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:06,350
<i>of our six-day race to claim
the most European countries.</i>

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,066
<i>Right now we're in
the middle of day two,</i>

4
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,400
<i>and Ben and Adam have just
managed to flip the lead.</i>

5
00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,350
<i>Tom and I started
today well ahead</i>

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,150
<i>with France, Belgium,
and the Netherlands,</i>

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,066
<i>while Ben and Adam had
only managed to lock down</i>

8
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,266
<i>Switzerland and Germany
on day one.</i>

9
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:19,250
<i>But early this morning,</i>

10
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>they stole France
out from under us</i>

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,866
<i>by completing a challenge
in Saint-Louis</i>

12
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,350
<i>and then raced us to Austria.</i>

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,566
<i>We managed to get there first,
claiming the country</i>

14
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:28,066
<i>and briefly tying the score.</i>

15
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:30,266
<i>But Ben and Adam arrived
only minutes later,</i>

16
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:31,916
<i>and after a
nerve-wracking challenge,</i>

17
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:34,466
<i>stole the country before
we had time to lock it.</i>

18
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:35,850
{\c&H00FFFF&}Yes!{\c}

19
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,033
{\c&H00FFFF&}Ohh!{\c}
{\c&HFFFF00&}Let's call them. Let's call them.{\c}

20
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,166
<i>That means
the score is now 4-2,</i>

21
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,966
<i>and we're about to get the call
with the bad news.</i>

22
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,616
{\c&H00FF00&}Nnngh.{\c}

23
00:00:44,616 --> 00:00:46,316
{\c&Heeeeee&}Oh, I'm getting a call.{\c}
{\c&H00FF00&}Oh no.{\c}

24
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:47,550
{\c&Heeeeee&}This is gonna be it.{\c}
{\c&H00FF00&}Oh no.{\c}

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,300
{\c&H00FF00&}Okay, right. <i>(sighs)</i>{\c}

26
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, it could go
one of two ways.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,616
<c.green>It could go one of
two ways. Here we go.</c>

28
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:53,933
{\c&H00FFFF&}Gentlemen...{\c}

29
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:55,983
{\c&H00FF00&}They're happy. They look happy.{\c}

30
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,033
<c.yellow>Gentlemen, we played
a wonderful song.</c>

31
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,433
{\c&H00FFFF&}A beautiful song.{\c}

32
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,350
<c.yellow>And we've done it
perfectly flawlessly.</c>

33
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,766
<c.yellow>And we've stolen
the country of Austria.</c>

34
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,000
{\c&HFFFF00&}Austria is now ours.{\c}
{\c&H00FF00&}Alright.{\c}
